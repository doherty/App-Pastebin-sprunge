NAME
    App::sprunge - Application class for pasting to and reading from
    sprunge.us

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use App::sprunge;
        my $app = App::sprunge->new();
        $app->run();

DESCRIPTION
    App::sprunge provides an application interface to
    WWW::Pastebin::Sprunge::Create and WWW::Pastebin::Sprunge::Retrieve,
    which allow creating and retrieving pastes on the <http://sprunge.us>
    pastebin.

METHODS
  new
    new() is the constructor, and creates an application object. Takes no
    parameters.

  run
    run() runs the application.

    Takes two optional parameters:

   Options
    The first is an options hash reference.

    *version*
        If present, the application will print out version information and
        exit.

    *lang*, *syntax*
        If present, the application will append this to the returned URI.
        <http://sprunge.us> uses Pygments <http://pygments.org> for syntax
        highlighting. In the future, there might be a check that the
        supplied syntax highlighter is one supported by Pygments.

   Arguments
    This is an array reference. Only the first element is used. It is either
    the URI to a paste to read, or the ID portion of the URI (the query
    string). If this is present, the application will read and print out the
    specified paste.
