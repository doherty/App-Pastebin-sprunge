VERSION
    version 0.007

SYNOPSIS
        use App::Pastebin::sprunge;
        my $app = App::Pastebin::sprunge->new();
        $app->run();

DESCRIPTION
    App::Pastebin::sprunge provides an application interface to
    WWW::Pastebin::Sprunge::Create and WWW::Pastebin::Sprunge::Retrieve,
    which allow creating and retrieving pastes on the <http://sprunge.us>
    pastebin.

    This distribution provides an executable sprunge, which provides a
    simple command-line client for <http://sprunge.us> using this library.

METHODS
  new
    new() is the constructor, and creates an application object. Takes no
    parameters.

  run
    run() runs the application.

    If *lang* is present, the application will append this to the returned
    URI. <http://sprunge.us> uses Pygments <http://pygments.org> for syntax
    highlighting.
