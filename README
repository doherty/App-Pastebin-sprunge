NAME
    App::Pastebin::sprunge - Application class for pasting to and reading
    from sprunge.us

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use App::Pastebin::sprunge;
        my $app = App::Pastebin::sprunge->new();
        $app->run();

DESCRIPTION
    App::Pastebin::sprunge provides an application interface to
    WWW::Pastebin::Sprunge::Create and WWW::Pastebin::Sprunge::Retrieve,
    which allow creating and retrieving pastes on the <http://sprunge.us>
    pastebin.

    This distribution provides an executable sprunge, which provides a
    simple command-line client for <http://sprunge.us> using this library.

METHODS
  new
    new() is the constructor, and creates an application object. Takes no
    parameters.

  run
    run() runs the application.

    Takes two optional parameters:

   Options
    The first is an options hash reference:

    *   If *version* is present, the application will print out version
        information and exit.

    *   If *lang* is present, the application will append this to the
        returned URI. <http://sprunge.us> uses Pygments
        <http://pygments.org> for syntax highlighting. In the future, there
        might be a check that the supplied syntax highlighter is one
        supported by Pygments.

   Arguments
    The second parameter is an array reference. Only the first element is
    used. It is either the URI to a paste to read, or the ID portion of the
    URI (the query string). If this is present, the application will read
    and print out the specified paste.
